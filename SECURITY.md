# Security Guide for PPG Project

## 🔒 Important Security Notes

This repository is **PUBLIC**. Please follow these security guidelines:

### ✅ What's Already Protected:
- Hardcoded secrets have been removed
- Sensitive files are in `.gitignore`
- Environment variables are used for secrets

### ⚠️ Before Making Public:

1. **Environment Variables**: Set up proper environment variables for:
   - `SECRET_KEY` (Flask app)
   - Any API keys or database credentials

2. **Check for Sensitive Data**: Ensure no personal data, API keys, or credentials are committed

3. **Model Files**: The `.pkl` files are currently ignored. If these are important models, consider:
   - Hosting them separately (Git LFS, cloud storage)
   - Including them with a license notice
   - Or keeping them ignored if they contain sensitive data

### 🚨 Never Commit:
- API keys
- Database passwords
- Personal data
- Private keys
- Configuration files with secrets

### 📋 Deployment Checklist:
- [ ] Set `SECRET_KEY` environment variable
- [ ] Configure database credentials via environment variables
- [ ] Remove any hardcoded URLs or endpoints that shouldn't be public
- [ ] Test that no sensitive data is exposed

### 🔧 Environment Setup:
```bash
# Set your secret key
export SECRET_KEY="your-secure-secret-key-here"

# For production, use a strong random key
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
```

### 📞 If You Find Sensitive Data:
1. **IMMEDIATELY** remove it from the repository
2. Change any exposed credentials
3. Consider the data compromised
4. Use `git filter-branch` or BFG Repo-Cleaner to remove from history
